### Computer Vision Interation Project

Sam Coleman and Kate Mackowiak

#### Project Goals:

Our project goal is to use c++ and opencv to identify a pointer finger, and use it as input to do a task. Our minimum viable goal is to use that input to allow the user to draw pictures. An extension of this is having the user be able to select different colors and line thicknesses by pointing at different options for some amount of time. Our stretch goal is to use the input from a pointer finger (as well as potentially the whole hand) to create a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures. This mouse should have the ability to scroll on a page, for maximum ergonomics. 

#### Learning Goals:

Our primary goal is to gain familiarity with opencv and c++. Our second goal is to learn how to research a subject that we have minimal familiarity with and take a project on it from start to finish. Finally, we want to make a cool project that looks good on a portfolio. 

#### Starting Resources:

We've found a few resources on tracking hands and fingers using opencv in python, which should be tranferable to c++. Beyond that our plan to find more involves searching stackoverflow for similar projects that we can learn from and adapt to our use case.

#### First Steps:

##### 1. Attempt to install opencv for c++ - Sam and Kat 

Successful completion: spent >1 hour and no luck (in this case talk to Steve during class), or a c++ file recognizes the imported opencv class.

##### 2. Create an inital header and cpp files and commit to github. - Kat

Successful completion: files are on github.

##### 3. Watch youtube crash course on c++ - Sam

Successful completion: basic understanding of c++.
